\label{ch: Model-free ILC with Recursive Convergence Acceleration}

The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to formulate the ILC recursive equation (Eq. \ref{eq:ILClaw}) into a closed-form, and a “ recursive convergence rate acceleration equation ” is observed. By using such the equation, the learning rate of any stable learning law can be further accelerated. 

%Moreover, since the updating computation avoids the division by noisy output signals ,the unpredictable learning transient is reduced naturally, and the tracking performance in steady-state can also be improved by avoiding the use of the noisy data-based learning filter over the whole learning procedure. 

The derivation of the proposed algorithm will be discussed in section 3.1, and the stability and robustness of the proposed algorithm will be analysed in section 3.2 and 3.3.
