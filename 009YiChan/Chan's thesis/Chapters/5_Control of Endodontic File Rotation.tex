\chapter{Control of Endodontic File Rotation}
\section{Problem Definition}
(Main cause of Files Fracture instrument fracture)					
\par\noindent
(File property)
\section{The Proposed Method and Theorem}
(CACS2020 Prototype 1)							
\par\noindent
(Motion Planning: sections)(Current threshold setting)
\par\noindent
Once the current of the file is in excess of the threshold, it will inversely rotate to release torque. A decline(decrease/increase/drop) in the current of the motor is indicative of contact resistance of the file.
