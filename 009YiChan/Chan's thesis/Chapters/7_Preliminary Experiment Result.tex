\chapter{Preliminary Experiment Result}
\section{Experimental Setup}
(Communication protocol – EtherCAT, RTOS – NI target)						\\
For 7.2 experiment: (Stewart-Platform + PhaseSpace + markers)				\\
For 7.3 7.4 experiments: (Acrylic root canal model + truth tooth)
\section{Admittance Control}
(Metrics: position comparison between the target and the robot)
\section{Automatically Direction Changing}
(Metrics: time, completeness and file breakage)								\\
(Completeness definition: comparison of pixel area before and after experiment via image)
\section{Repetitive Experiment}
(Metrics: file breakage, compare with and without reverse)
