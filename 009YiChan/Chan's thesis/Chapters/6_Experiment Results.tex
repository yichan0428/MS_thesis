\chapter{Preliminary Experiment Result}
\section{Experimental Setup}
(Communication protocol – EtherCAT, RTOS – NI target)						
\par\noindent
For 6.2 experiment: (Stewart-Platform + PhaseSpace + markers)				
\par\noindent
For 6.3 6.4 experiments: (Acrylic root canal model + truth tooth)
\section{Admittance Control}
Validation of admittance control
\par\noindent
(Metrics: position comparison between the target and the robot)
\section{Automatically Direction Changing}
Validation of Self-alignment Mode
\par\noindent
(Metrics: time, completeness and file breakage)								
\par\noindent
(Completeness definition: comparison of pixel area before and after experiment via image)
\section{Repetitive Experiment}
validation of repetitive experiment
\par\noindent
(Metrics: file breakage, compare with and without reverse)
