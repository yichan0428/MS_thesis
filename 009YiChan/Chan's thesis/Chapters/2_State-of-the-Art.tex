\section{Dental Robot}
There is a commercial robot, YOMI \ref. YOMI has received the clearance from FDA and has performed more than $2,700$ times surgery in the USA. In the pandemic of Covid-19 in 2020, YOMI provided non-contact surgery between dentists and patients due to its automatic robotic system. 

There is one robotic system that is designed to perform the endodontic therapy. In Intelligent Micro Robot Development for Minimum Invasive Endodontic Treatment \cite{Dong2007WIPAS}, they proposed a micro robot performing root canal treatment with the assistance
of 3D computer model system. It utilizes the 3D model to plan the corresponding path to accomplish an endodontic treatment.
