\hspace*{6mm}Advancements in robot-assisted surgery invigorates researches on robotics in the dental field. Reviewing the literature on dental robots, this thesis aims to develop a root-assisted system for endodontic treatment to improve the success rate of surgery. Considering the workspace and extreme precision in endodontic treatment, our robot-assisted system - DentiBot consists of a robot arm, an F/T sensor. System integration solutions are examined in the thesis. Moreover, to overcome the two main failures of surgery - incomplete root preparation and instrument fracture, novel ideas to perform endodontic treatment with DentiBot are presented in this thesis. First, Force-guided alignment based on admittance control is involved to calibrate the surgical path in real-time. Second, file feedrate control is addressed to protect endodontic files from fracturing. Last but not least, an algorithm based on the above functions is proposed to achieve high performance in root preparation. The technical experiments have validated the feasibility of Force-guided alignment and a pre-clinical experiment has proved file feedrate control and our proposed algorithm.
