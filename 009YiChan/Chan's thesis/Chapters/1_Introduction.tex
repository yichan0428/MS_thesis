\chapter{Introduction}
\hspace*{6mm}Endodontic treatment, also known as root canal treatment and nerve extraction, is performed to cure an infected tooth. The procedure of endodontic treatment is divided into three parts - Opening, Cleaning, and Filling shown in  Figure \ref{fig:endo-procedure}.

\newpage
An infected tooth arises from periodontal disease, attrition, trauma, or decay. Once the dental pulp is infected, it causes an irreversible inflammation and lets patients confront a root canal treatment. Figure \ref{fig:endo-procedure} shows an infected tooth and its dental pulp, which consisted of blood vessels, nerves, connective tissues, and lymphatics. In the "Opening" step, an experienced dentist drills the crown of the infected tooth to remove the dentin and expose the infected pulp inside the canal to the air. Next, in the "Cleaning" step, the dentist uses an endodontic file, a flexible reamer, to remove the infected pulp. Then, in the "Filling" step, the dentist uses a dental plugger to fill the empty root canal with Gutta-percha, a plastic substance. "Filling" can prevent cross-infection between root canals because the cured tooth remains many invisible and inaccessible pulp tissue. Finally, the dentist seals the root canal with a new crown to protect cured root canal. 
\par
"Cleaning" is of paramount importance in a whole treatment because untreated cleaning will result in pulp necrosis, apical abscess, periodontal ligament inflammation, or even cellulitis. If there are many remained infected pulp after root canal treatment, the surgery should be operated on again.
\section{Motivation}
\hspace*{6mm}The performance of the endodontic treatment depends on the dentist's long-term expertise. A qualified dentist can operate the endodontic treatment and accumulate their experience to increase the success rate. With many experiences, dentists can acquire an endodontist license. According to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, R.O.C. (Taiwan), the number of dentists in Taiwan is $15,178$. However, according to The Academy of Endodontology, R.O.C. (Taiwan), there are only $238$ dentists to acquire an endodontist license due to the expertise of endodontics. Besides, Root canal treatment is tedious and time-consuming due to the complicated conditions of each tooth. A patient who suffered from an infected tooth spends countless hours see a dentist. It takes at least two to three rounds, even takes more than two months in the worst case. 
\par
Therefore, our team looks forward to designing a robot-assisted system to finish the root canal treatment. The definition of a robot-assisted system in the present thesis refers to be a dental assistant. With the system, we wish it can increase the success rate for dentists and provide patients a safe surgery.

\section{Previous Work and Problem Definition}
Use present tense.
(Previous work: briefly mention the existing dental robots)
\par\noindent
(Problem definition:
1.	Assist dentists to operate RCT and focus on cleaning procedure
2.	Root canal cannot be visually observed and is too small to clean well
3.	Risk of file breakage)		
\par\noindent
Instruments fracture and perforation are two main problems that commonly occur during the therapy. Removal of broken files is both technically difficult, and therefore it is essential to reduce the probability of fracture. In addition, root canal treatment also requires repeatedly drilling to clean the canal thoroughly.  This repetitive action of root canal treatment is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, we designed an automatic endodontic robot to improve the time efficiency and prevent instrument fracture in endodontic surgery.
The root canal cleaning is a big challenge in and of itself.
There is one robotic system that is designed to perform endodontic therapy. In Intelligent Micro Robot Development for Minimum Invasive Endodontic Treatment [3], they proposed a microrobot performing root canal treatment with the assistance of a 3D computer model system. It is designed to accomplish endodontic therapy with a path planned according to the 3D model. However, the problem of instruments fracture remains. 
In this paper, a torque monitoring method is proposed. The leading causes of fractured files are torsional fracture and flexural fatigue, which account for 55.7\% and 44.3\% separately [5]. Therefore, we use current feedback to keep track of the file's torque during the endodontic treatment. This torque monitoring system is implemented on an endodontic robot prototype we built. We primarily focus on the cleaning and shaping step since it is the key to a successful root canal treatment. With the robot prototype and torque monitoring system, we could reduce the possibility of instrument fracture. Besides, the repetitive action during the drilling step can be performed by the robot.		
\section{The Proposed Method}
(Solutions: (be consistent with problem definition)
1.	Build a robot-assisted system and enable it to drill
2.	Force-guided alignment 
3.	Control the file rotation speed
B.	Prospect:
\par\noindent
(Prospect: Move to the infected teeth$\longrightarrow $Root canal searching$\longrightarrow $Repetitive drilling$\longrightarrow $Apex Detection)						
\section{Main Contributions of the Thesis}
